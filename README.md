# toggle-hotspot

A simple Android app that allows toggling the WiFi Hotspot. Comes with an app for Google Wear devices. Perfect if you travel a lot and tired of fishing your phone out of your pocket each time you need internet and you happen to have a laptop without its own 3G/4G modem.

The hotspot terminates after there are no clients connected to it. The app checks the number of connected clients about once a minute and terminates at the third check without clients.
